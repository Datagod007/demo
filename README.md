# Analyzing Twitter Users' 2020 Reflections usingÂ NLP
### A Sentiment Analysis Project using Python and Tableau

This is a Sentiment Analysis Project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques. In December 2020, I felt it would be a good idea to obtain insights into how Twitter users felt about the year. Twitter receives over 500 million tweets per day from its users across the globe, so I only had to find a way to retrieve the data. This Notebook makes use of several Python libraries like Pandas (for Data Cleaning/Manipulation), Tweepy (for Tweets Mining), NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), TextBlob (for Sentiment Analysis), MatPlotlib &  WordCloud (for Data Exploration), Emot (for Emojis identification), Plotly (for some Data Visualisation)
In the Jupyter Notebook, you will leearn how I carried out the following steps for the project:

1. Import Libraries
2. Tweets Mining
3. Data Cleaning
4. Location Geocoding
5. Tweets Processing
6. Data Exploration
7. Sentiment Analysis
